# GA2A4J - Google Agent2Agent Protocol for Java

## Project Overview

GA2A4J is a Java SDK that wraps the Google Agent2Agent protocol, facilitating communication between independent AI agents. This project is structured as a multi-module Maven project with the following components:

### Module Structure

1. **GA2A4J SDK Module**
   - Core SDK implementation of the Agent2Agent protocol
   - Provides reusable components for building A2A-compatible applications
   - Can be used as a dependency in other projects

2. **a2a-rest Module**
   - Spring Boot REST API implementation of the A2A protocol
   - Package: `com.ramix.a2a`
   - Implements the specific endpoints required by the Google Agent2Agent protocol
   - Uses the SDK module as a dependency

## Core Concepts

- **Agent Card**: A public metadata file (usually at `/.well-known/agent.json`) describing an agent's capabilities, skills, endpoint URL, and authentication requirements.

- **A2A Server**: An agent exposing an HTTP endpoint that implements the A2A protocol methods. It receives requests and manages task execution.

- **A2A Client**: An application or another agent that consumes A2A services. It sends requests to an A2A Server's URL.

- **Task**: The central unit of work. A client initiates a task by sending a message. Tasks have unique IDs and progress through various states.

- **Message**: Represents communication turns between the client and the agent. Messages contain Parts.

- **Part**: The fundamental content unit within a Message or Artifact. Can be TextPart, FilePart, or DataPart.

- **Artifact**: Represents outputs generated by the agent during a task. Artifacts also contain Parts.

## Typical Flow

1. **Discovery**: Client fetches the Agent Card from the server's well-known URL.

2. **Initiation**: Client sends a request containing the initial user message and a unique Task ID.

3. **Processing**:
   - (Streaming): Server sends SSE events as the task progresses.
   - (Non-Streaming): Server processes the task synchronously and returns the final Task object.

4. **Interaction**: If needed, the client sends subsequent messages using the same Task ID.

5. **Completion**: The task eventually reaches a terminal state (completed, failed, canceled).

## Getting Started

To build the project:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

This will build both the SDK and REST API modules.

## Dependencies

- Java 11+
- Lombok
- Spring Boot (for the REST API module)
